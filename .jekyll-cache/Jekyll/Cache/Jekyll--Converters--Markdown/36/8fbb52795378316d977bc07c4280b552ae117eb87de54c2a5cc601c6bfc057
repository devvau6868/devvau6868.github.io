<h1 id="programming-for-beginners">Programming for Beginners</h1>
<p>In the beginning, coding is going to be tough – you are essentially learning a new language to communicate ideas in! There is no easy way how to start programming for beginners.</p>

<p>If you’re completely new to this sort of stuff, it will be nothing like anything you have done previously. Stick with it though. The longer you hang in there, the more likely you are to have a “eureka” moment and it will all start making sense.</p>

<p>You should start by choosing the programming language that seems most fitting for you. It is advised to choose a language that is mostly user-friendly or is not that hard to begin with. An example of that would be HTML or CSS, which are mainly used for basic web applications. If you are looking at more serious programming languages to start with, Python could be the one for you.</p>

<p>Above all, coding is about problem-solving. It’s not so much about memorizing all these functions that different lines of code create (although that’s incredibly useful). You can look at those functions up if you forget how to do something specific! Your skills as a problem solver, which are the most important skills regarding coding, will develop with the more time you spend training them.</p>

<p>For many, computer science and coding seem alien skills that are impossible to understand. Even if you’re already familiar with how networks and computer systems work, it’s still a good idea to give yourself a quick recap from the list below.</p>

<p>When learning programming, there are several things that you should fully understand:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Learn computer science basics for beginners. There are loads of great resources out there. Before you start searching where to start coding, you need a solid idea of how computers function!</li>
  <li>Understand how networks work. It’s important to know how different computers can communicate with one another in various types of networks. This will make it easier to understand the concepts that are introduced later.</li>
  <li>Familiarise yourself with the command line. Here’s where you’ll finally start to feel like you are getting to know how to start coding! Entering text into the command line can be a bit scary at first but you don’t need to fear. It’s very difficult to do any real damage!</li>
  <li>Next, it’s important to know how to start building a website and get a domain. This stuff isn’t going to challenge you too much, but it is crucial in your journey to becoming a web developer.</li>
</ul>

<h1 id="client-side-front-end">Client-Side Front-End</h1>
<p>Every page you visit on the internet is built using certain programs that work side by side with each other. The browser you use is the translator that translates the code that is built either by the HTML, CSS, or JavaScript. As a result, we see the result on our screen and interact with it along the way. There are three main front-end languages:</p>

<h2 id="html">HTML</h2>
<p>If you’ve never done any web development whatsoever, you’re going to want to start with HTML.</p>

<p>HTML stands for HyperText Markup Language. Put simply, it’s used to make basic webpages. It’s not technically a programming language at all. However, if you’re completely new to coding, it’s still nothing like any language you’ll be familiar with.</p>

<p>Whenever you see images or text on the web, they will have been put there primarily using HTML. HTML allows you to place text, images, videos, songs, and other content onto a webpage using what are called “tags”.</p>

<p>There isn’t a whole lot you can do with HTML but what you can do appears all over the internet. It’s therefore really important to get a good grasp of HTML before you get to know how to start coding career or hobby as a web developer.</p>

<p>Check out the beginners’ guide to <a href="https://www.bitdegree.org/course/coding-for-beginners">coding in HTML</a>. You’re welcome!</p>

<p><img src="https://www.bitdegree.org/tutorials/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/learn-coding-1.png" alt="example Some basic HTML on Notepad" /></p>

<h2 id="css">CSS</h2>
<p>The next logical step to learning how to develop websites is to learn CSS. This still isn’t a programming language though! However, it does introduce a load more variety into your websites and is another crucial step you need to take before you start programming in more interesting languages!
<img src="https://www.bitdegree.org/tutorials/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/learn-coding-2-768x335.png" alt="Example of how to start codingThis is how CSS looks like" /></p>

<p>CSS makes the stuff you made using HTML look good. You can do all kinds of neat tricks with it such as adding color, padding (borders), margins, and changing fonts.</p>

<p>A good grasp of CSS and HTML can make a half-decent looking website. However, if you want to be a developer, you’re going to have to learn some real programming languages too!</p>

<p>To learn to use CSS like a pro, check out this awesome guide to getting started with CSS.</p>

<h2 id="javascript">JavaScript</h2>
<p>Let’s not sugar coat it. If you want to learn how to start coding to a high level, you’re going to need a good knowledge of JavaScript.</p>

<p>When learning programming, JavaScript is a must. It’s everywhere. These days, you’ll be hard-pressed to find a company that doesn’t want some kind of online presence. JavaScript will be used to build most of their applications and websites.</p>

<p>Being such a widely-used programming language, job opportunities are great for someone skilled at programming in JavaScript. That said, in a recent survey of developers by StackOverflow, it was found that a massive 62.5% of respondents said that they used it. 
<img src="https://www.bitdegree.org/tutorials/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/learn-coding-3.png" alt="how to start coding JavascriptThis is how JavaScript code looks like" /></p>

<p>This means that finding a JavaScript job is going to be hugely competitive too. Although the path of how to start coding can be tough it will be worth it though. PayScale estimates that the average salary of a JavaScript web developer is almost $60,000. There’s lots of money to be made if you’re good!</p>

<p>JavaScript adds interactive features to your list of web developer tools. These might be games or responses to the text being entered – that kind of thing.</p>

<p>You can start by making small adjustments to your basic HTML webpages. These can include welcome messages and image changes. However, you can progress to making full three-dimensional games if you get good enough at coding in JavaScript!</p>

    <h1 id="what-to-learn-next">What to Learn Next?</h1>
    <p>After learning these basic coding languages and concepts, you’ll be starting to get a feel of what you’re good at and what you like to create using the code. Below are some of the next areas you should consider studying:</p>
  </li>
  <li>Learn how to use Git and GitHub. After familiarising yourself with these tools, you can sign up for a GitHub account and start making commits. Employers often favor active GitHub users.</li>
  <li>SQL – if you love the heavy database stuff, SQL is a great programming language to learn. Since practically every application uses databases in some way, SQL programming knowledge is a great skill to have while learning how to start coding.</li>
  <li>Solidity – the programming language of the Ethereum blockchain is a particularly good one to learn. It’s used to implement smart contracts and Ethereum developers with such skills are in high demand right now. It’s only a matter of time before someone develops a killer dApp application on the Ethereum network using Solidity – it could be you!</li>
  <li>jQuery – jQuery is like a toolbox for JavaScript developers. It’s been developed to speed up typing JavaScript code. Many tasks are grouped to mean they can be added with a single line of code.</li>
  <li>Swift – Swift is the programming language of iOS applications. Since Apple products are so consistently popular, being a skilled Swift coder will certainly land a great job. What’s more, iOS applications are generally a lot more profitable than those that appear on Google Play or other such application stores.</li>
</ul>

<h1 id="what-now">What now?</h1>
<p>This is just the beginning of your education. The thing with technology is that it doesn’t stay the same for long. This is particularly true with web development.
