We all need to take a break sometimes. Oddly, though, many people leave their vacation time unused. Whether you take a vacation, a staycation, or a playcation, it's important to take a break from the job, the routine, and the demands of life in order to keep stress levels in check.

When we take a break, we're not shirking responsibility; we're taking care of ourselves so we'll have the stamina to be our best. Here's why it's important to take a break.

# Symptoms of Chronic Stress
Letting stress build up can be unhealthy in several ways. The body is designed to respond to short bursts of stress, but when stress is prolonged and the stress response is triggered repeatedly and on a regular basis—as can happen in a stressful job or a conflict-ridden relationship—the situation turns into one of chronic stress, where the real health problems set in.

Those who experience chronic stress are more susceptible to conditions ranging from more frequent headaches and gastrointestinal issues to more serious conditions like high blood pressure, which brings an increased risk of heart disease and stroke. When our allostatic load, or overall level of stress, accumulates to a certain level, stress can just snowball because we're constantly in a state of reactivity.

At this point, even positive events can feel overwhelming if they take energy to enjoy, and we're not able to respond from a place of strength and wisdom, but rather from a place of anxiety, or we work on auto-pilot.

# Benefits of Taking a Break
Vacations and even shorter breaks where we get some physical and psychological 'space' from the demands of life can bring many rewards. Obviously, we feel less stress when we're not in a stressful environment.

But vacations bring more than that. They interrupt the cycle of stress that can lead to being overwhelmed. They give us a break from chronic stress so we can restore ourselves physically and mentally to a healthier place.

Because a chronically-triggered stress response can lead to decreased creativity, memory problems, mild cognitive impairment, and other issues, this break in the stress cycle can lead to sharper thinking and increased creativity that can spill into all areas of our lives. This makes us better at our jobs, more available in our relationships, more energetic with our families, and more able to enjoy life for a prolonged amount of time after we return.

# Warning Signs
Sometimes, it's obvious when a vacation is necessary. But other times, the stress we experience can sneak up on us, and we may be less able to recognize when we're at risk for overwhelm and burnout.

Because we all respond to stress in unique ways, our signs of overwhelm may be unique as well. However, there are some general warning signs that apply in most cases. If you're experiencing one or more of the following, it's a good idea to start planning some downtime, even if it's in the form of a weekend 'staycation' to recharge your batteries.

> # Signs That You Should Take a Break
> Lack of energy
> Lack of motivation
> More frequent frustration
> Feeling 'fuzzy-headed
> Mild health issues
> Sleep disturbances due to stress

In fact, unless you feel energized, motivated, excited, creative and fully engaged at work and in your relationships, you'd likely benefit from a vacation because it's a good idea to manage stress before it feels overwhelming. Vacations, 'mental health days', and regular self-care can keep you functioning at your best.

# Ideas and Solutions
If you need a break, there are several different options for getting one. You can go for a long and luxurious break, a relaxing and simple one, or short and sweet. You can even have minutes-long breaks that you take throughout the day to keep productivity higher and to keep from feeling overwhelmed.

The following are resources for each type of break. Take your pick, and take a break today.

# Vacation
A real break, in the classic sense of the word, taking a vacation is more important than many people realize, which is why many vacation days go unused when they should be enjoyed to the fullest.

The key to a restful vacation is to prioritize rest and fun when you go; don't overbook yourself with tourist activities or bring so much work with you that by the time you return you feel you need a vacation from your vacation.

Taking Vacations for Stress Relief and Overall Health
# Staycation
The staycation is becoming more and more en vogue, especially as people have a greater need to take a break, but with fewer means to pull off an exotic trip. The staycation is all about rest and relaxation, and enjoying the place you are often too stressed and busy to really enjoy: home sweet home.

The key to a refreshing staycation is the same as the key to a restful vacation, though somewhat trickier to pull off: don't overdo it, and don't let work creep in. That means no cleaning, office work, or dealing with regular responsibilities. You can either turn off the phones, ignore email, and make it a point to both rest and play or go to a nearby hotel to make it easier.

How to Relax on Your Staycation

# Playcation
Few people talk about having a playcation, but it's a great idea: stay home, but make it fun! The difference between a staycation and a playcation is that staycations tend to focus more on resting and relaxing, while playcations are for—you guessed it—fun!

With the hard work and stressful routines that characterize many people's lifestyles, it's important to have some fun (like Billy Crystal did to 'get his smile back' in the classic movie City Slickers) as a way to recharge your batteries and be sure you're enjoying life. You can devote several days to taking a playcation, or just be sure you pepper in some fun on a regular basis.

# Short Breaks
Sometimes we just need to take a break from stress long enough to disrupt the body's stress response cycle, and then get back into the action.

For quicker options, you might want to take a hike or a bike ride, enjoy a movie, or even have a 5-minute meditation session. With these ideas for ​quick breaks, you'll have several ideas from which to choose.
